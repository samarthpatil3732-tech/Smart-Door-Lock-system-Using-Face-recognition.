Project Overview

This Smart Door Lock Security System uses Face Recognition + OTP verification to enhance home and office security. It combines computer vision, email alerting, and Arduino-controlled locking. The camera scans the face for 10 seconds and verifies users using a trained dataset. If the face does not match, the system sends an intruder image to the owner’s email. If the face matches, OTP authentication is required for final unlocking, making it more secure than traditional locks.

🔹 Objectives of the Project

To develop a modern, technology-driven security system.

To replace traditional keys and locks with contact-less authentication.

To detect unauthorized access attempts and alert the owner instantly.

To combine AI (face recognition), IoT (Arduino lock control), and cybersecurity (OTP mail system).

🔹 Why this Project is Important

Enhances security and surveillance in smart homes.

Eliminates risk of key theft, duplicate keys, and password leakage.

Captures evidence by sending intruder images remotely.

Adds two-level authentication, making break-ins more difficult.

Supports real-time monitoring without physical presence.
